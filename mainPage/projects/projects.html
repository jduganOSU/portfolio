                    Dive deep into the projects I've worked on both in class and in my free time. Each project has taught me various aspects of software development, design, and more. I hope you find them as interesting as I found working on them!

                    Click on the 'Learn More' button for each project to read about the project and my thoughts before, during and after development. The purpose of 
                    these pages are to discuss the project bluntly, as if I am describing my thoughts and decisions to someone sitting next to me. It 
                    may be a bit informal.

                        OrganRegistry is a web application to manage and track organ donations and transplants. With features like adding, updating, and deleting organs, it's been a cornerstone of my development journey.
