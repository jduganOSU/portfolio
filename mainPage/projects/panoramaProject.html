                    <p class="project-description">
                        The Panorama Project was an idea I had for an application, mostly as a challenge to myself. 
                        While not perfect, I am happy with the project and think it is about 90% of what would be the finished product. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The idea behind this project started when I was using Google Maps. Occasionally, when bored, I would explore the Google 
                        Maps page. One thing I'd like to do is go to a place I had never been before, like the Sahara Desert, and look at the 
                        street view images there. For example,
                        <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@29.2074517,25.4358709,3a,75y,150.85h,92.92t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipPD0kvSjuT2tkYNMGyNk70_B85gIl0JdogsyXHY!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipPD0kvSjuT2tkYNMGyNk70_B85gIl0JdogsyXHY%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya125.40241-ro-0-fo100!7i8704!8i4352?entry=ttu" target="_blank">
                            here is a street view image of a spot in the Sahara Desert.
                        </a>
                        The idea for the project would be to allow the user to click on a map, and the application would take the user to the nearest 
                        Google Maps street view image, which are all panorama images.

                        <h3>Homepage</h3>
                        <p><a href="https://github.com/jduganOSU/panoramaProject-solo/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/Homepage.js" target="_blank">

                        <p>
                            The application opens up to the homepage. There are some simple instructions on the 
                            homepage that informs the user how to interact with the application. 
                            The homepage code is simple, but contains 
                            a component called MapComponent. 
                            <a href="https://github.com/jduganOSU/panoramaProject-solo/blob/main/frontend/src/components/worldmap.js" target="_blank">

                            </a>
                            The MapComponent is a Google Maps API Map. There is functionality within 
                            the MapComponent code that allows the user to click on the map, and the coordinates of that click are 
                            recorded. Once the user clicks on the map, the MapComponent navigates the user to a new webpage, called 
                            'Individual'. This occurs in line 42 of the MapComponent code. The latitude and longitude coordinates are 
                            contained within the new URL the user is sent to, which is important, because the 'Individual' needs
                            these coordinates to perform some tasks
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-overview">
                        <h3>Individual Page</h3>
                        <p><a href="https://github.com/jduganOSU/panoramaProject-solo/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/Individual.js" target="_blank">
                            View the code for the Individual Page
                        </a></p>
                        <p>
                            Next we go to the individual page. As stated earlier, the individual page makes use of the latitude and longitude coordinates
                            that are in the URL by using useParams. The Individual page then uses Google Maps API to find a panorama within the radius
                            of the given coordinates. It does not actually get the panorama view at this point, rather 
                            it returns the data on that panorama and saves it in a variable (by using React Hooks) called panoData. The way it's set up currently is that the Google Maps API finds the 'best' panorama within the given radius.
                            I would like to change this to finding the nearest panorama to the coordinates, and that is something that a future version of 
                            this application would have. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At this point, the variable panoData should have the data of the panorama view. The data includes things like the coordinates of the 
                            panorama, the images themselves, and more. Once panoData is not Null, the Individual page renders the 
                            <a href="https://github.com/jduganOSU/panoramaProject-solo/blob/main/frontend/src/components/panorama.js" target="_blank">
                                PanoramaViewer component. </a>
                            This component takes the panoData as a parameter and actually generates the panoramic view, displaying it on the user's screen.
                            
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-overview">
                        <h3>Favorites Page</h3>

                        <p>
                            I added the ability for the users to save panoramas they find interesting to the website for future users to look at. This 
                            is done by making use of MongoDB. The MongoDB table contains the Latitude, Longitude and Date Generated data on the panorama. 
                            It also allows the user to create a small (less than 25 characters) description of the panorama. Lastly, it allows users 
                            to view that saved panorama.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="feature-overview">
                        <h3>ChatGPT API Page</h3>
                        <p><a href="https://github.com/jduganOSU/panoramaProject-solo/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/CoordinateGenerationPage.js" target="_blank">View the ChatGPT API Page code</a></p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, I included a page where the user can interact with ChatGPT and try to generate coordinates by giving a prompt. The hope
                            was for the user to be able to give a prompt like "The coldest place on Earth" and the app finds a panorama in the North or South Pole, 
                            however I have found prompts that vague usually don't work. The API uses the gpt-3.5-turbo model, so when future models become
                            available for API, there is a chance the user can be more vague. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When the prompt does work, I have set up the API call to return the latitude and longitude coordinates generated by the model. 
                            The program then uses those coordinates to navigate to the Individual page the same way it would if the user clicked on the MapComponent. 
                        </p>
