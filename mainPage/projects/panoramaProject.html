    <h1>Panorama Project</h1>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/jduganOSU/panoramaProject-solo" target="_blank">Link to Panorama Project Code</a></p>
    
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>"Panorama" is a full-stack web application that integrates Google Maps and OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate and display panoramic views based on user input. The application allows users to interact with a Google Map and generate panoramic views of any location they click on. Additionally, users can enter a description of a location, and the application uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate the coordinates of the described location, then displays a panoramic view of the generated coordinates.</p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Interactive Google Map for users to select locations.</li>
        <li>Integration with OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate coordinates based on user's description.</li>
        <li>Display of panoramic views of selected or generated locations.</li>
        <li>A favorites page where users can view their favorite panoramas.</li>
        <li>Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflow for deployment on Heroku.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Stack</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Frontend: React.js for building the user interface, CSS for styling.</li>
        <li>Backend: Express.js and Node.js for handling requests and responses.</li>
        <li>Database: MongoDB for storing user's favorite panoramas.</li>
        <li>APIs: Google Maps API for map and panorama generation, OpenAI's GPT-3 API for generating coordinates based on user's description.</li>
        <li>Deployment: Heroku.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Role and Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>As the sole developer on this project, I was responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Designing and implementing the frontend and backend of the application.</li>
        <li>Integrating Google Maps and OpenAI's GPT-3 APIs.</li>
        <li>Setting up the MongoDB database to store user's favorite panoramas.</li>
        <li>Deploying the application on Heroku.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project Outcomes</h2>
    <p>The project was successfully completed and deployed. It demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development, working with third-party APIs, asynchronous programming, database management, and deployment. It also showcases the ability to integrate artificial intelligence into a web application. The application's codebase is well-organized and includes unit tests to ensure the functionality of the application.</p>
