                <h2>Organ Registry Project</h2>
                <p class="project-description">
                    The Organ Registry was built as the final project for my Databases course. The main goal was to 
                    implement a database, however the project required a user to be able to interact with the database 
                    and perform CRUD operations. So while the project was build for a databases course, it required 
                    us to create a functional application using many Web Development concepts. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project got me very comfortable to making API requests within the application. For every CRUD operation, 
                    there had to be a call to the backend of the application, which would handle the attempted operation. The project
                    also taught me the importance of keeping an organized project. About a quarter of the way through the project, 
                    I had all the 'Routes' in the app.js file. Realizing I still had many more routes to implement, I stopped 
                    the development and took a day to reorganize the project. The result was separating the project files into views,
                    routes, public (which contains the Javascript that handled the CRUD operations and the CSS file), and lastly a database 
                    directory. This made a huge difference in future project development.

                        The most important aspect of the project was creating the database. There were certain parameters we needed to fulfill 
                        for the class, including at least one many-to-many relationship. Here is the Schema for the database:

                    <p>
                        As mentioned earlier, about a quarter of the way through I completely reorganized the project. This helped me 
                        understand how much clearer and easy to comprehend a project becomes when you organize things appropriately. 
                        Handlebars was used because that's just what the instructor used in their example. I didn't have a problem using 
                        it and picked up on the syntax. I had never heard of handlebars before this project and don't see any jobs 
                        or companies discussing it, so I'm not sure if/when I'll be using it again. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="project-phase">
                    <h3>After:</h3>
                    <p>
                        If this application were going to be actually used, there are some things that would need to be added. Some entities do not 
                        have all 4 CRUD operations implemented, because this was not a requirement for the project. I could implement
                        them for my portfolio, however I think I have already demonstrated the ability to implement these operations. Additionally, 
                        the front end of the project could be better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, the Organ Recipient Match could be taken a step further. The idea behind the 'Organ Recipient Match' entity 
                        was that the Registry app would analyze the Organs donated and Recipients (people who need a new organ), and if 
                        the Organ would be a match for the Recipient, that match would be stored in the 'Organ Recipient Match' table. A few things
                        that stopped me from that implementation is that I do not know exactly what determines a good match. The thought was 
                        if the blood types match and the Organ Donor's zip code was within a certain radius of the recipient, the program would 
                        match those two and add them to the 'Organ Recipient Match' table. However, this was not a requirement of the project, 
                        and frankly this implementation would be a step above the purpose of the project in my portfolio. Additionally 
                        I assume there is more that goes into matching an Organ to a Recipient.

                    <p>
                        I believe this project displays my skills in full stack development. The Registry app makes use of a backend, 
                        gathering data from a database and implements the logic for CRUD operations on that database. The front end, while
                        somewhat basic, is easy to understand.
