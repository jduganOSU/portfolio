            <h2>Personal Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Hey everyone! My name is Jack Dugan, a current computer science student with a thirst for learning. I first
                graduated from Moravian University in 2018 with a degree in Finance. I have spent the last 4 years working 
                as an investment analyst/associate at an investment firm. My journey towards software/web development started 
                in 2022 when I embarked on a project that required gathering historical NBA data. To do so, I taught myself Python
                by taking Harvard's CS50 online course, then built a simple web scraping program. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This self-initiated challenge not only re-introduced me to coding &#40;I dabbled in college&#41; but ignited a curiosity
                to understand and craft technology solutions. I soon realized that the joy I derived from coding wasn't just a passing phase
                but a genuine passion. Consequently, I enrolled in the post-baccalaurette Computer Science program at Oregon State University.

            <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
            <p class="placeholder">
                After graduating from Moravian University, I started a job in an investment firm, where I have been for the 
                past 4 years. My role has mostly centered around the real estate assets of the firm, an asset group I have always
                found interesting. These last 4 years have taught me alot, especially the importance of communication and attention 
                to detail. The skills I have learned over the last few years will certainly translate well both in my future career
                and personal life.
