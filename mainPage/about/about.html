            <h2>Personal Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Crafting solutions through code, one line at a time. Hey there, I'm Jack Dugan! Currently 
                immersing myself in the dynamic world of computer science, my journey here is a blend of 
                passion and purpose. I originally graduated from Moravian University in 2018 with a Finance 
                degree and spent four enriching years as an investment analyst/associate.
                While in college, I had my first taste of coding, and though it was brief, it left an impression. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                Fast forward to 2022, when a personal project nudged me to dive deep into the realm of software 
                and web development. Tasked with gathering historical NBA data, I turned to Python, guided by 
                Harvard's CS50 course, and engineered a web scraping program. The exhilaration of turning an idea 
                into a functional piece of software was transformative. 
                It wasn't just the code; it was the ability to craft solutions and see immediate results that captivated me.
                Recognizing this newfound passion was not fleeting, I committed to formalizing my education, 
                enrolling in Oregon State University's post-baccalaureate Computer Science program. As I continue to 
                navigate and learn, I'm eager to harness the power of technology to create impactful solutions.

        <!-- Professional Journey Section -->
        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
            <p>
                After securing my degree from Moravian University, I embarked on a rewarding journey with an investment firm, 
                specializing in its real estate assets. The intricate nature of real estate 
                investment honed my attention to detail, while the need to convey information sharpened my communication skills.  
            </p>
            <p>
                These competencies, I believe, are universally valuable. Whether it's poring over lines of code to ensure 
                functionality, or translating tech jargon into clear, comprehensible insights for a team, the discipline and 
                clarity I've cultivated will enhance my contributions in the tech realm and beyond.

            <h2>Future Goals</h2>
            <p>
                As I look towards the future, my ambition is to immerse myself in cutting-edge technological domains that 
                captivate me. I'm fundamentally 
                drawn to the challenge of understanding complex systems and harnessing the latest in technology to craft 
                innovative solutions. It's not just about understanding the current landscape but also about anticipating 
                what's next and positioning myself to be an active contributor in that evolution. I seek environments that 
                encourage continuous learning and collaboration, where I can both contribute and grow, translating my 
                passions into tangible solutions and experiences.
